    - name: "UpWork Client"
      title: "Data Analysis Project"
      text: "'Jonathan was fast, communicative, and highly professional. He quickly understood the needs of our ask and the complexity of the research that needed to be visualized. While we provided a few drafts, they were sometimes incomplete. He was great about filling in our missing components, and quick to ask clarifying questions to complete the work. Final data visualizations reflected the accuracy and detail required by the team. The project started with a super tight turnaround, but the timeline changed a couple timesâ€”he was flexible, patient, and accommodating throughout these changes! Thanks, Jonathan!"
